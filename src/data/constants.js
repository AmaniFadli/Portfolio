This competition addresses societal issues aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), focusing on Goal 5 (gender equality) and also relating to Goals 3, 4, 9, and 10. We identified the growing issue of digital gender-based violence, which needs innovative solutions. Detecting these patterns in conversations can be challenging. Our solution is DALIA, a mobile app using AI to recognize verbal violence through patterns, words, and phrases in conversations. It also includes behavior analysis tests to help users become more aware of their communication.",
